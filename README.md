# Determining Which Passengers of the Titanic Stayed alive

This project is most likely a rite of passage for everyone interested in computer science. I never liked the movie, but the door could easily accommodate both Rose and Jack. <br> This is a binary classification issue in which the passenger either survived or perished. Here is a list of the dataset's columns: <br>

- PassengerID - A unique identifier for each column.
- Survived - Regardless of wether or whether the passenger survived (1). (0)
- Pclass - The ticket class of the traveler. One, two, or three.
- Sex - Sex of a passenger (male or female)
- Passenger Age - The passenger's age.
- Sibsp - The amount of siblings or spouses on the Titanic.
- Parch - The overall amount of parents and children on board the Titanic.
- Ticket - The quantity of a passenger's ticket.
- Fare - The cost of a passenger's ticket.
- Cabin - The size of a passenger's cabin.
- Embarked - The port where the passenger boarded the ship. 
- C means Cherbourg 
- Q means Queenstown
- S  means Southampton 

Despite the fact that we know who survived the Titanic, the project may still be used to apply significant ideas in machine learning and data science. So there you have it!

Predict which passengers survived the Titanic (Jack died)

Techniques that I did:

- Pandas, matplotlib, numpy
- Polynomial regression, cross-validation, k-nearest neighbours
- Recursive feature elimination
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Regular expressions
- Scikit-learn
- Heatmap
- Random forest classifier
- Grid search
